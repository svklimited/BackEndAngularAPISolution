 This demo back End API solution written in .net core 2.2 to server the data from the SQL database and the connection string pointed to the local SQL Server instance.

 As soon as you run the API solution in local; it will automatically seeded the initial data set to the local sql instance database.
 
 The API solution will exposes the REST API, using the repository patterns; which creates an abstraction layer between the data access layer and the business logic layer and finally persists the domain-specific objects through ORM (Entity Framework) in a code first approach.
